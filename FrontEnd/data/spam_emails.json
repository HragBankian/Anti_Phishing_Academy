( mogi - news ) announces\nthat the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this\ntime . the surface lease has been constructed and we have\nbeen waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and\nanticipate this to happen next week at the latest .\nthe company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project .\nsymbo | - mogi\ncurrent price - . 26\nreasons to consider mogi :\n1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |\nmarket in a generation .\n2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .\n3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on\nreserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less\nthan 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets .\n4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn\nunproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready\nshares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market .\nin fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the\npast year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and\ndeveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being\nmade . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even\nquadruple returns .\nbreaking news ! !\napril 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its\nsylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and\nroad closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig\nwas moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m\nwell . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in\ncompliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well\nimmediately there after .\nthe company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion\nof tie in upon lifting of the road ban .\nwith the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and\ngas has prepared a detailed project description .\nproject history\nthe sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and\nhas produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil\nand 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,\npredominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field\nremains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and\nexpanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .\nthe original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major\noil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an\nexploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was\nabandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely\neroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company\ndid no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the\ncomplaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the\ndeeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the\nwest one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in\nthe early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as\nmineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more\nspecifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral\nrights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil\nand gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .\nthrough diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered\nthis relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since\nthat time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres\n( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %\nof this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in\n5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .\nland discussion\nour partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and\nnortheast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480\nacres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling\nspacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\ngeological discussion\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\nproduction facilities discussion\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\nconstructed .\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\noil product to the transportation system .\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\nconclusion :\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are\nalready familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for\nyou ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch\nthis one trade tuesday ! go mogi .\npenny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable\nfor all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way\naffiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars\nto distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and\nadvertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .",

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\ndear shareholder , addlrko\ni am writing to you today to\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\nlast week we announced that abdv\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\nyou may ask ; why the energy\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\nso what do we do with our\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\nby concentrating on a specific\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\nfine wein records , inc .\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\ncorporation , inc .

( source :\ncompany website ) currently trading at . 012 p\npossibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has\nstarted and is expected to last all week . pp\nimagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so\nif you had the scoop on the following stock : p\n( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this\nlittle giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5\nweeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p\nas many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\nprice because they are promoted , making a very large number of\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\nlet ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\notc : dmxpp\nabout the company : p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\nfound in north america . p\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\nmoves forward . p\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\nexploration is justified . p\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\nfinance additional exploration . p\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\nextensive exploration program . pp\n( source : company website ) p\nrecent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\nconference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\npreparation of work program . p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\nexploration findings in south america . p\ndelta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\nexploration in south america . pp\nwill dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\nthe stock this weekend and next week ?

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former\nmilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )\nwho died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as\ni was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,\nhence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .\ni have lost confidence with anybody within the country .\nhaving noted the confidence reposed on your person ,\ni became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving\nthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general\n( my husband ) .\nthis money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for\nsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .\nit is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my\norganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this\norganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .\non your acceptance to render this assistance to me\nto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\nnon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\nto my full assistance and unlimited\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\nsins\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\nco - operation highly confidential .\nbest wishes ,\nmrs . mariam abacha .",
