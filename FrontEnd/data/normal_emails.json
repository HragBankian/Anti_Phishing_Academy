this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected .\nplease note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .\nrestricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a \" top of stack entry \" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .\nin order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as restricted top of stack \" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the \" allowed \" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \" restricted top of stack \" feature .\nadvanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" all \" option from the drop down box .\nwebsite changes\nnew submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .\nthe submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .\nprice of limit orders\nmodify limit orders\ncustomers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the \" today ' s orders \" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the \" set \" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .\nexpiration time for limit orders\ncustomers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .\nfloat the today ' s orders section\nyou can now float the \" limit order \" section . in order to do so , right click in the \" today ' s orders \" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window \" stay on top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .\nmid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .\nin order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .\nchanges to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .\nplease note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .\nif you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .\nsavita puthigai",

( e . g . the product bar might before have said : \" basis\nlink - parent \" and now would say \" stand alone , parent \" ) .\ndetailed feature descriptions\nmultiple children\nthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together\nin a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product\nb , which is in turn linked to parent product c .\nwarning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a\nchain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a\ncustomer attempts a transaction , the database must \" lock \" each and every\nproduct in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the\ndatabase must then update the stack for each product before releasing the\nlocks . \" vertical \" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are\nmuch slower to process than \" flat \" chains ( one parent with many children ) .\nlarge vertical chains should be avoided .\nrelated to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the\nsame parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent\nproduct b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link\nto the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated\nbasis link and a regular basis link .\nstatic product bar prices\nthe new version of enrononline provides for \" sticky \" product bar price and\nvolume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not\nreset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you\nhave logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or\noffsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the \" + \" or \" - \" buttons .\none of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it\nreduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if\nthe price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price\nmovement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the\nwebsite to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder\nfor customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update\nmoves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering\nan appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price\nmovement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,\nimproving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure\nrate .\nyou may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field\nfor offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products\nwhich have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .\nsorting / selecting\nthe new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting\nfunctionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,\nlocation , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple\nsorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then\nlocation while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first\nby product type and then within each product type , by location ( in\nalphabetical order ) .\nif you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort\ncriteria , plus you can select \" sort by web order \" , which allows you to see\nyour products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the\nwebsite ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a\nnumber of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .\nwhen you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left\nmouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while\nmaking your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not\nnecessarily adjacent to one another .\nparent products and f / x products\none of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its\ntreatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the\ntype of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of\nthe main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version\ndoes not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for\nmore than one type of link on each parent product .\nsome traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now\nidentified with a stylised \" fx \" in the product list . this is to enable easy\nidentification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the\nparent , rather than managed individually .\nassistance\nas always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,\nplease contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )\n20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .\ngeneral feedback\nif you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further\nfunctionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had\npreviously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this\nrelease , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard\nto improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your\nrequests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",

( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203\n10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the\nrate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this\ntransaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in\ndec . who is this assigned to for jan ?\nhpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december\nand january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back\nnext week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .\npat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to\nthe present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can\nproceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned\nissues .\nhank eisenhours duties were split :\nmandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,\ndecember flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .\ncarlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all\noffsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey\nalso handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas\nfor december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .\nhpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for\npathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .\nhpl operational seems to be left unassigned .\ni think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks\nresponsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",

' '\nenbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .\nthe intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .\nit forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .\nenbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .\nthird quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .\n\" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , \" said tutcher . \" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

        "text": "Subject: tenaska iv gas\ndaren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and\nwilliams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few\nitems i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was\ncancelled ) :\n1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should\nhave been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )\nand not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -\n230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at\n2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .\n2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged\n$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91\nprice , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at\n2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .\ni reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for\n2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment\nif delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and\nincrease by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at\n. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .\nin reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price\nis 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache\ninvoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at\nother places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if\nenron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a\nmargin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant\nshould not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .\nlooking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and\noctober , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from\nwilliams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot\nprices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our\nmeeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of\n$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas\ndelivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .\nso based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their\nnovember invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price\ndifferences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of\n$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of\ntenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .\nmonth plant gas price amount\nnovember 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843\nnovember adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )\noctober adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )\nnov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000\nsept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52\ntotal $ 484 , 234 . 03\ni discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before\nreaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts\nthat i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .\njames",

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to\nsee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep\nthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .\nanother email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment\ngauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you\nclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the \" wiggling \" that\noften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !\na big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to\nhear that so many people are enjoying the tips .\ntalk to you again in a few weeks .\njon garbison\non - line editor\nwoodsmith\nvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :\n100 + woodworking plans :\nwoodsmith magazine :\nshopnotes magazine :\nworkbench magazine :\nkits , jigs , tools , project plans :\nback issues :\nwoodworking forums :\nto change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at\nto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :\nnote : your subscribed email address is",

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )\nthis may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where\nnominations were sent for entire month )\ncan ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe\nguards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .\nunify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause\nan additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order\nto get a clean quick response .\nwhat are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take\nplace ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )\ni have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i\ncan get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to\nput some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when\nthese type of changes are needed .\nwill keep you posted .\nthanks ,\ndg\nfrom : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am\nto : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l\nhernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect ,\nstephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy\nhedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect\ncc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye\nellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ\nseverson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect ,\nregina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e\nkasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven\ngullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect\nsubject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )\nregarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with\nconfirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :\nif someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the\nability for you to invalidate the deal - and\nthen change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :\n\" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\npipeline allows this change . \"\nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\nin case it causes problems with their\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\nthe unify team .\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\nmarket east - but not from\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\nthe same legal entity .\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\nwere locked down for a reason .\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\nunify .\n- -

        "text": "Subject: california energy crisis\ncalifornia \u0001 , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several\nmonths . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .\nplease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation\nand our position on california energy issues .\nwhat happened in california\nthe source of california \u0001 , s current problem is as straightforward as supply\nand demand . california \u0001 , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,\npredictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10\npercent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related\nfactors that led to the current crisis . first , the state \u0001 , s regulations\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for\npower is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long\nterm , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in\ncalifornia , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine\nwhile the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained\nin effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep\ncompetition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the\nregulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\nin short , california \u0001 , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .\nregulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new\ngeneration from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile\nspot prices .\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned\nthe state \u0001 , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,\nif adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\nenron \u0001 , s role\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix\nthe problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the\npoliticians and the media . here are the facts :\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the\nstate of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the\nsame market available to other california purchasers . because we are a\nmarket maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products\nfor our customers .\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from\nthe problems the states \u0001 , utilities , and their customers , now face . we\nprotected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply\npower directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on\nthe open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001 enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western\npower markets . enron \u0001 , s primary business is managing risk for our customers\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more\ndemand for our products and services .\nthe solution\nthe solution to california \u0001 , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the\nstate must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market\nand shore up the financial stability of the state \u0001 , s utilities .\nincreasing supply\ncalifornia \u0001 , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing\nshort of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less\nthan a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply\nmust streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and\ndisplacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new\nfacilities .\nreducing demand\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .\nthey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail\nmarket would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand\nat lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\nreducing reliance on the spot market\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer\nterm , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands\nof the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .\nopening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their\nprice risk .\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state \u0001 , s institutions\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to\ngreater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to\narrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is\nneeded .\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,\nwhile politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters\nworse . price caps have been proposed . they don \u0001 , t work ; have never worked ;\nand they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how\nineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley\nor silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current\nshortage worse .\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in\ncalifornia . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,\nconstructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in\ncalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power\ngeneration - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads\nand other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the\ncrisis from the media , it \u0001 , s important for you to know this : we at enron will\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real\nsolutions to the state .",

gain access to additional sources of gas supply and\nachieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate\npipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the\noptimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\nthe skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\nupstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\noperation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\noperations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\nskills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\nopportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\naccomplish this objective across n . america .\nwe have proven our

along the\ngulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\noperations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\nparty producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\nit is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\ncompetitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related\nmatters

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",

( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .\n2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )\n3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .\n4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .\n5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .\n6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .\n7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .\n8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .\n9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .\n10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .\n11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .\nthe ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .\nplease let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .",

changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\npipeline allows this change . \"\nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\nin case it causes problems with their\npipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\nthe unify team .\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\nmarket east - but not from\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\nthe same legal entity .\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\nwere locked down for a reason .\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\nunify .\n- -

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time .

why do all the\ninternational lines except russia fly american\nplanes ? why does no other land on earth even\nconsider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you\ntalk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .\nyou talk about german technocracy , and you get\nautomobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,\nand you find men on the moon - not once , but several\ntimes - and safely home again .\nyou talk about scandals , and the americans put\ntheirs right in the store window for everybody to\nlook at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued\nand hounded . they are here on our streets , and most\nof them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are\ngetting american dollars from ma and pa at home to\nspend here .\nwhen the railways of france , germany and india were\nbreaking down through age , it was the americans who\nrebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the\nnew york central went broke , nobody loaned them an\nold caboose . both are still broke .\ni can name you 5000 times when the americans raced\nto the help of other people in trouble . can you name\nme even one time when someone else raced to the\namericans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was\noutside help even during the san francisco\nearthquake .\nour neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one\ncanadian who is damned tired of hearing them get\nkicked around . they will come out of this thing\nwith their flag high . and when they do , they are\nentitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are\ngloating over their present troubles . i hope canada\nis not one of those . \"\nstand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !\nthis is one of the best editorials that i have ever\nread regarding the united states . it is nice that\none man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of\nthe world would realize it . we are always blamed for\neverything , and never even get a thank you for the\nthings we do .\ni would hope that each of you would send this to as\nmany people as you can and emphasize that they\nshould send it to as many of their friends until\nthis letter is sent to every person on the web . i am\njust a single american that has read this , tribute to\nthe united states\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ?

        "text": "Subject: california energy crisis\ncalifornia ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\nwhat happened in california\nthe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\nin short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\nenron ' s role\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \" turnback \" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\n? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\n? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\n? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\nenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\nthe solution\nthe solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .\nincreasing supply\ncalifornia ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\nreducing demand\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\nreducing reliance on the spot market\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .",

sally beck\nsubject : project hurricane / bridgeline status\nhere is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .\nbetween enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline\npipeline systems :\nsummary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the\nname of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %\nenron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading\non the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in\nthe process of being drafted .\nenron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to\nsupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand\nthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps\nscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st\nfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen\ncenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv\nwill start in early february for march production .\nto do ' s :\naccounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it\ntransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next\nmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same\npage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .\npc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my\nrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .\nnetworks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the\nvoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot\nis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a\ncombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been\nrequested .\nlocation on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from\nfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .\ncurrently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall\ncubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall\ncubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .\ndata conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and\nmeter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin\ntrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump\nof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .\nwe also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need\nto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the\nsystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know\nwho else will need access .\ninterface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada\napplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright\nfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two\napplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .\nthere will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s\nrtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime\nthere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything\nis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between\npop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is\ncomplete .\nscada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to\nenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to\nthem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs\nby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best\ndone as a part of the scada transition .\naccounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be\nbetter defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this\nprocess started .\nhourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be\nbilled on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk\nthrough this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least\ninitially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the\nbilling for this one customer .\nplease let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have\nmy assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached\nat 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",

. . . . texas , and how\nthey want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell\nthem how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is\nthe world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in\neverything a & m does .\n4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at\na & m .\nthere are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '\nanswer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never\nlearned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,\nforget the fact that a however ,\nnobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of\nthe military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act\nlike the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect\nthese clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is\nonly supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat\nup civilians , move to israel .\n5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national\ntelevision and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the\nstands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be\nagainst the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to\nmount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime\nanything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and\nstart sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked\ndown upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have\nmoved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were\ngagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,\nsome boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s\nthanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a\nsuckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .\nsome of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique\ncounter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give\nthem a veil .\n6 ) \" t . u . \" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if\nfolks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be\nfunny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .\nplease learn .\n7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of\nsheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall\ndown . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit\nwhooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for\nthe enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing\nhow to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for\ngovernor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form\nasks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 \" , weight\n185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east\ntexas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade\neducation why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .\nthis is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .\n8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,\nthey might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .\nthe point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about\nmarching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high\nschool band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then\nand nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you\ndo care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?\n9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the\nonly\njustifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an\nanal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .\n10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat\ntheir own feces and should be treated accordingly .\n11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that\nit is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that\nshould be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any\nbetter than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending\n\" dukes of hazard \" episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to\naustin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open\nminded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace\nand final resting place of all that is cool .\nas my friend stephen johnson once said : \" if the world were ever to get an\nenema , college station is where you would connect the hose . \" if you go to\nschool at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie .\ngod bless the great state of texas .\nbrian puls\nsoftware engineer\nlockheed martin - enterprise solutions\n281 218 - 2740",

if\nparty b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the\n300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay\ntco pool index plus a premium .\ni understand that this type of transaction is currently done\nover - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of\nsitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .\nbjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then\nmy turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to\nthe varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will\nrequire three different product types ?\nplease feel free to call if you have any questions .\ndale\n3 - 9746",

( and his bong )\n4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally\nraising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the\nvanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .\n5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums\nof political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows\nof poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .\n6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to \" invent the\ninternet \" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks\nof potentially incriminating e - mail !\n7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were\nthe models for the book and movie , \" love story \" even though the book ' s\nauthor , erich segal , says not .\n8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s\nchampion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million\ndollars in occidental petroleum stock .\n9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president\nclinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain\nsilent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton \" one of\nthe greatest presidents of our history . \"\n10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they\nwon ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so\nineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of\ntennessee ' s senators !\n11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will\nbe the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served\nto the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down\nslum house that he was renting to them .\ncautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are\ngenerally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there ,\nunfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to\nactually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their\nailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and\nthat of the usa .\ntherefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to\naid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to\nyour normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate\ntreatment .",

[ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , \" the nopr noted .",
